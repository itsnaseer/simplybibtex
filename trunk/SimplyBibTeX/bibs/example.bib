   Abstract = {In order to develop appropriate tools for decision support in 
design processes, it is necessary to found
them on an understanding of design. Analytical techniques of design processes that have a direct
relationship with tool development can enhance design support systems development. The paper
focuses on a design support system in the VR-DIS research program. The aim of this research program
is to develop insight in the architectural design process and to establish design tools for architects
working in Virtual Reality. The basic approach for data modelling in VR in this research is based on an
extension of the Feature Based Modelling paradigm taken from design in mechanical engineering. The
computer model of the design in the system is a Feature-based model. This paper describes design
processes in terms of changes in the Feature-based model of the design. For this purpose, a case of a
house design is used. Drawings in the conceptual design phase up to the preliminary design phase are
studied. Each state of the drawings is described in terms of a Feature-model. Particular design actions
such as creation of spaces, definition of architectural elements, and changes during the design process
can be expressed in terms of changes in the Feature-model. Because of the use of Features, the changes
can be formalised in the VR-DIS system. The description in terms of Features offers an analytical tool
that leads to a functional brief for design support tools. The paper ends with a discussion of
implications and future work.},
