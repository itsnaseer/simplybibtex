  abstract       = {In order to develop appropriate tools for decision
                   support in design processes, it is necessary to found
                   them on an understanding of design. Analytical
                   techniques of design processes that have a direct
                   relationship with tool development can enhance design
                   support systems development. The paper focuses on a
                   design support system in the VR-DIS research program.
                   The aim of this research program is to develop insight
                   in the architectural design process and to establish
                   design tools for architects working in Virtual Reality.
                   The basic approach for data modelling in VR in this
                   research is based on an extension of the Feature Based
                   Modelling paradigm taken from design in mechanical
                   engineering. The computer model of the design in the
                   system is a Feature-based model. This paper describes
                   design processes in terms of changes in the
                   Feature-based model of the design. For this purpose, a
                   case of a house design is used. Drawings in the
                   conceptual design phase up to the preliminary design
                   phase are studied. Each state of the drawings is
                   described in terms of a Feature-model. Particular
                   design actions such as creation of spaces, definition
                   of architectural elements, and changes during the
                   design process can be expressed in terms of changes in
                   the Feature-model. Because of the use of Features, the
                   changes can be formalised in the VR-DIS system. The
                   description in terms of Features offers an analytical
                   tool that leads to a functional brief for design
                   support tools. The paper ends with a discussion of
                   implications and future work.},
