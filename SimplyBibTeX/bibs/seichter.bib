  abstract       = {The aim of this paper is to demonstrate a software
                   prototype using AR Toolkit [1] for collaborative
                   augmented reality sketching in architectural design. I
                   introduce a non-intrusive interaction technique
                   developed for this prototype. Additionally, sketching
                   and distribution mechanisms will be discussed and
                   illustrated The prototype uses non-photo-realistic
                   rendering and an adaptive tessellation mechanism in the
                   geometry, kernel to provide a visual cue for the
                   conceptual stage of an architectural design.},
